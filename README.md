# Ballpark-tracker
<p>Full Stack app made with Django and Python</p>
<p>In this application you will be able to create stadiums that you have visited.  You can also write a description about the ball park and the location of where it is.  Once a stadium is created you can view those details and be able to add concessions and keep track of your night at the ballpark</p>

Upon opening this application you will be asked to login. If you do not have a login yet you can sign up in the upper right hand corner.

Once you are signed in, it will take you to the main details page, which will be a list of all stadiums you have visited. If you do not have any stadiums you can create them from the add stadiums button in the nav bar.

After you create your stadium you can view the details of your post on this page.  This page will also have an interactive concessions tab where you can keep track of basic concessions at the ballpark.

## Next Steps:
- I plan to add photo's to the app where the user can create a stadium and choose the teams photo that coincides with the stadium.
- I plan to add more relationship models so there's more to do on the app.
